# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Interactive game/entertainment system is a kid-friendly application that transforms passive video watching into an engaging, interactive learning experience. The system allows children to answer quiz questions through physical gestures (jumping jacks, squats, hands-on-head, waves) while videos automatically pause at predetermined checkpoints. They can also enjoy games like "Subway Surfers" using their gestures instead of playing the same game on a touch screen. Parents can create games by providing YouTube or MP4 links, with the system auto-generating quiz questions and checkpoints. The application prioritizes child safety through on-device processing, provides comprehensive reporting for both mental and physical engagement metrics, and features an accessible, high-contrast user interface optimized for young users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a child user, I want to answer quiz questions using physical gestures so that I can stay active while learning from videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video reaches a quiz checkpoint THEN the system SHALL automatically pause the video
2. WHEN a quiz question is displayed THEN the system SHALL show gesture options (jumping jack, squat, hands-on-head, wave) with clear visual indicators
3. WHEN the child performs a gesture THEN the system SHALL recognize the gesture within some time (eg 5 seconds) using pose detection
4. WHEN a correct gesture is performed THEN the system SHALL provide positive audio/visual feedback and resume the video
5. WHEN an incorrect gesture is performed THEN the system SHALL allow retries with encouraging feedback
6. WHEN gesture recognition fails or times out THEN the system SHALL provide alternative input methods or skip options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a parent, I want to create interactive quiz games from video content so that I can provide engaging educational experiences for my child.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I paste a YouTube or MP4 link THEN the system SHALL validate and accept the video source
2. WHEN I specify the number of questions THEN the system SHALL automatically generate quiz checkpoints distributed throughout the video duration
3. WHEN checkpoints are generated THEN the system SHALL create multiple-choice questions relevant to the video content at each checkpoint
4. WHEN I review the auto-generated content THEN the system SHALL allow me to edit questions, answers, and checkpoint timing
5. WHEN I publish a game THEN the system SHALL make it available for children to play immediately
6. IF video content is inappropriate THEN the system SHALL warn me and suggest content guidelines

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a child user, I want to play action games like subway surfers using physical activities so that I can have fun while being active and engaged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start an action game THEN the system SHALL present game scenarios that require physical movements to control gameplay
2. WHEN I perform running motions THEN the system SHALL translate these into forward movement in games like subway surfers
3. WHEN I jump or squat THEN the system SHALL make the game character jump over obstacles or duck under barriers
4. WHEN I lean left or right THEN the system SHALL move the character to avoid obstacles in the corresponding direction
5. WHEN I perform specific gestures THEN the system SHALL trigger special game actions like collecting items or power-ups
6. WHEN the game session ends THEN the system SHALL display both game score and physical activity metrics
7. IF I get tired during gameplay THEN the system SHALL offer pause options and suggest rest breaks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a parent, I want to view detailed reports of my child's performance so that I can track their learning progress and physical activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access reports THEN the system SHALL display mental engagement metrics including quiz scores, median response times, retry counts, and consistency ratings
2. WHEN I view physical activity data THEN the system SHALL show total repetitions by gesture type, form accuracy percentage, and total activity time
3. WHEN I view game performance THEN the system SHALL display action game scores, movement accuracy, and physical intensity levels
4. WHEN metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL present simple 0-100 indices for easy understanding
5. WHEN I request historical data THEN the system SHALL provide trends over time for both mental and physical metrics
6. WHEN I export data THEN the system SHALL provide reports in common formats (PDF, CSV)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a parent, I want to ensure my child's privacy and safety while using the application so that I can trust the system with my family's data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pose processing occurs THEN the system SHALL perform all analysis on-device without sending video data to external servers
2. WHEN a child has mobility limitations THEN the system SHALL provide a seated mode with alternative gesture options
3. WHEN family data is stored THEN the system SHALL restrict access to family members only with no third-party sharing
4. WHEN I request data deletion THEN the system SHALL permanently remove all associated data within 24 hours
5. WHEN I want to export data THEN the system SHALL provide complete data export functionality
6. IF the system detects inappropriate content THEN the system SHALL block access and notify parents

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a child user, I want an easy-to-use interface with clear visual and audio cues so that I can navigate and play independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display large, high-contrast UI elements suitable for children
2. WHEN interactions occur THEN the system SHALL provide immediate audio feedback for all actions
3. WHEN gesture calibration is needed THEN the system SHALL complete the process within 5-10 seconds with clear instructions
4. WHEN the child needs help THEN the system SHALL provide visual demonstrations of required gestures
5. WHEN the application is accessed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL support PWA installation for offline use
6. WHEN accessibility features are needed THEN the system SHALL support screen readers and keyboard navigation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable pose detection and gesture recognition so that the application provides accurate and responsive interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pose detection is active THEN the system SHALL use MediaPipe Tasks Vision pose landmarker for accurate body tracking
2. WHEN gestures are classified THEN the system SHALL apply custom classifiers with smoothing and debounce algorithms to reduce false positives
3. WHEN multiple users are detected THEN the system SHALL focus on the primary user in the center of the frame
4. WHEN lighting conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL provide feedback to improve camera positioning
5. WHEN gesture recognition confidence is low THEN the system SHALL request the user to repeat the gesture or provide alternative options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system, I need to store and manage game data efficiently so that I can provide fast, reliable access to content and user progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game episodes are created THEN the system SHALL store episode specifications as JSON with video metadata, checkpoints, and questions
2. WHEN user sessions occur THEN the system SHALL record session data including timestamps, responses, and performance metrics
3. WHEN gesture events happen THEN the system SHALL log gesture attempts with accuracy scores and timing data
4. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL NOT save any video files or camera images to protect privacy
5. WHEN the database reaches capacity limits THEN the system SHALL archive old session data while preserving user progress summaries
