## Implementation Highlights

### Enhanced Focus Management
```typescript
// Custom focus trap with proper keyboard handling
useFocusTrap(modalRef, isOpen, {
  initialFocus: emailInputRef.current,
  escapeDeactivates: true,
  returnFocusOnDeactivate: true,
});
```

### Accessibility-First CSS Classes
```css
.auth-focus-outline {
  @apply focus:outline-none focus:ring-4 focus:ring-offset-2;
}

.auth-button-focus {
  @apply focus:ring-wiggle-pink/60;
}

.touch-target {
  min-height: 44px;
  min-width: 44px;
}
```

### Screen Reader Announcements
```typescript
// Live region announcements
announce('Account created successfully. Redirecting to your dashboard.', 'assertive');
```

## Recommendations for Ongoing Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test with actual screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- [ ] Verify keyboard navigation on different browsers
- [ ] Test with high contrast mode enabled
- [ ] Validate with users who use assistive technologies
- [ ] Test on mobile devices with TalkBack/VoiceOver

### Automated Testing Integration
- [ ] Add axe-core accessibility tests to CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Include Lighthouse accessibility audits
- [ ] Set up automated color contrast validation
- [ ] Monitor accessibility metrics in production

### Performance Considerations
- [ ] Ensure accessibility features don't impact performance
- [ ] Test with reduced motion preferences
- [ ] Validate with slow network connections
- [ ] Monitor bundle size impact of accessibility libraries
