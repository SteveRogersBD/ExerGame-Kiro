# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Parental Gate feature is a child safety mechanism for WiggleWorld, a kids' exergame platform. This feature creates a barrier that requires parental involvement before children can access the main game content. The gate provides three different methods for parents to unlock access: email verification, PIN entry, and math problem solving. The implementation focuses on creating an engaging, kid-friendly interface while maintaining security best practices for child protection.

## Requirements
